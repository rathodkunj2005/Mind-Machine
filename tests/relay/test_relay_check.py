"""Mutation tests for scripts/relay_check.py.

The reviewer's point, which is correct: this checker's entire justification is
that an unchecked guard drifts silently, and it shipped without a guard of its
own. Nine mutations were run by hand and one real bug was found that way -- an
asymmetric owner/status rule -- but none of it was committed, so nothing stops a
later "simplification" from quietly removing a check.

Each case below mutates a known-good relay document in one way and asserts the
checker reports it. `test_the_pristine_document_passes` is the control: without
it, a checker that rejected everything would pass every other test here.
