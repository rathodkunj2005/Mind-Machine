"""Validate the structure of docs/CONTEXT_RELAY.md.

A handoff document nobody checks goes stale, and this repository has already
been bitten once: `memory_check.py` carries a guard added after the INDEX's
"current handoff" pointer drifted by eleven records with nothing catching it.

This applies the same idea to the relay. It does not judge whether the prose is
true -- no checker can -- but it does enforce the structure that makes the file
usable to whoever picks it up next:

- every required section is present, so an agent's read order does not break;
- every part has an owner, a state, and a branch (or an explicit em dash);
- every open thread carries a status from a fixed vocabulary, and nothing is
  marked CLOSED or ACCEPTED without evidence in the row;
- every relay log entry has the three fields the template promises;
- log ids are sequential, so an entry cannot be quietly dropped;
- every thread id cited in the log exists in the register.
