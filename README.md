# AccessLens

> A browser extension that keeps every student synchronized with the instructor's
> live screen and renders the same lesson in a form the student can access.

AccessLens is the primary product for the Minds & Machines: AI in Education
Hackathon. It addresses the **one-format classroom**: an instructor presents a
slide, diagram, video, website, or simulation in one form, and students who cannot
see, hear, parse, translate, or sustain attention on that form lose the lesson as
the class moves on.

The instructor explicitly starts an AccessLens session and chooses a browser tab,
window, or screen to share. The instructor extension recognizes the current
approved asset and sends small semantic events—such as slide ID, highlighted
region, pointer position, caption segment, and sequence number—through a temporary
AWS session. Student extensions follow automatically and render the event through
their chosen modes:

- **Hear:** concise audio description;
- **Focus:** one region or relationship at a time;
- **Read:** structured text, read-aloud, or approved language support;
- **Locate:** spatial directions or haptics; and
- **Explore in AR:** a synchronized spatial model of the current concept, with
  keyboard, touch, voice, and non-immersive equivalents.

Students do not need a camera for the core experience. Camera recognition is a
future, opt-in fallback for content that cannot be screen-shared, such as laboratory
equipment, specimens, studio work, field observations, and physical demonstrations.

## Current status

The repository has been reset around AccessLens. The product contract, system
design, technical stack, research basis, implementation plan, and demo runbook are
documented. The reviewed `bio-cell-demo` Access Pack, its AR cell model, and the event-sequence
simulator the other workstreams test against are implemented and checked by
`make check`. The browser extension and AWS session service are the next
engineering slices; production Canvas integration and camera mode are not
implemented.

## MVP journey

```text
Instructor opens the extension
        -> starts a session
        -> selects a tab/window/screen
        -> advances an approved biology deck
        -> extension emits slide/region/pointer events

Student opens the extension
        -> joins the session
        -> chooses an access mode once
        -> automatically follows the instructor
        -> receives Focus, text, caption, audio, and synchronized AR output
```

The MVP uses checked-in mock content. It does not scrape Canvas, silently capture a
screen, store recordings, infer disability or attention, or grade students.

Historical Evidence Engine implementation was removed from the active tree when
AccessLens became the explicit product direction. Git history remains the recovery
path for that superseded prototype.
